    FP16 Contributed by https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/pull/4889
    Note:
        Assume bboxes1 is M x 4, bboxes2 is N x 4, when mode is 'iou',
        there are some new generated variable when calculating IOU
        using bbox_overlaps function:

        1) is_aligned is False
            area1: M x 1
            area2: N x 1
            lt: M x N x 2
            rb: M x N x 2
            wh: M x N x 2
            overlap: M x N x 1
            union: M x N x 1
            ious: M x N x 1

            Total memory:
                S = (9 x N x M + N + M) * 4 Byte,

            When using FP16, we can reduce:
                R = (9 x N x M + N + M) * 4 / 2 Byte
                R large than (N + M) * 4 * 2 is always true when N and M >= 1.
                Obviously, N + M <= N * M < 3 * N * M, when N >=2 and M >=2,
                           N + 1 < 3 * N, when N or M is 1.

            Given M = 40 (ground truth), N = 400000 (three anchor boxes
            in per grid, FPN, R-CNNs),
                R = 275 MB (one times)

            A special case (dense detection), M = 512 (ground truth),
                R = 3516 MB = 3.43 GB

            When the batch size is B, reduce:
                B x R

            Therefore, CUDA memory runs out frequently.

            Experiments on GeForce RTX 2080Ti (11019 MiB):

            |   dtype   |   M   |   N   |   Use    |   Real   |   Ideal   |

        2) is_aligned is True
            area1: N x 1
            area2: N x 1
            lt: N x 2
            rb: N x 2
            wh: N x 2
            overlap: N x 1
            union: N x 1
            ious: N x 1

            Total memory:
                S = 11 x N * 4 Byte

            When using FP16, we can reduce:
                R = 11 x N * 4 / 2 Byte

        So do the 'giou' (large than 'iou').

        Time-wise, FP16 is generally faster than FP32.

        When gpu_assign_thr is not -1, it takes more time on cpu
        but not reduce memory.
        There, we can reduce half the memory and keep the speed.

    If ``is_aligned`` is ``False``, then calculate the overlaps between each
    bbox of bboxes1 and bboxes2, otherwise the overlaps between each aligned
    pair of bboxes1 and bboxes2.

    Args:
        bboxes1 (Tensor): shape (B, m, 4) in <x1, y1, x2, y2> format or empty.
        bboxes2 (Tensor): shape (B, n, 4) in <x1, y1, x2, y2> format or empty.
            B indicates the batch dim, in shape (B1, B2, ..., Bn).
            If ``is_aligned`` is ``True``, then m and n must be equal.
        mode (str): "iou" (intersection over union), "iof" (intersection over
            foreground) or "giou" (generalized intersection over union).
            Default "iou".
        is_aligned (bool, optional): If True, then m and n must be equal.
            Default False.
        eps (float, optional): A value added to the denominator for numerical
            stability. Default 1e-6.

    Returns:
        Tensor: shape (m, n) if ``is_aligned`` is False else shape (m,)

    Example:
        >>> bboxes1 = torch.FloatTensor([
        >>>     [0, 0, 10, 10],
        >>>     [10, 10, 20, 20],
