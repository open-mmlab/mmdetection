# MMDetection

**News**: We released the technical report on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07155).

## Introduction

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.1** or higher.

mmdetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. It is
a part of the open-mmlab project developed by [Multimedia Laboratory, CUHK](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/).

### Major features

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the detection framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized object detection framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple frameworks out of box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary detection frameworks, *e.g.* Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN, RetinaNet, etc.

- **High efficiency**

  All basic bbox and mask operations run on GPUs now. The training speed is faster than or comparable to other codebases, including [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron), [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark) and [SimpleDet](https://github.com/TuSimple/simpledet).

- **State of the art**

  The toolbox stems from the codebase developed by the *MMDet* team, who won [COCO Detection Challenge](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-leaderboard) in 2018, and we keep pushing it forward.

Apart from MMDetection, we also released a library [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) for computer vision research, which is heavily depended on by this toolbox.
